# SecureBluetoothControlledRobot

A Secure Bluetooth Controller Car project using Arduino Board.

## Need of Project
Many available projects on Bluetooth controlled robots are unsecure, an authorized user can connect to the robot and handle its operations which can be threat in various scenarios. This Project solves this security issue by allowing user to authenticate themselves before executing commands avoiding unauthenticated access to the robot.
